# Hey there! I'm Hanny üëã

I‚Äôm a passionate technology strategist/solutions architect with **7 years of experience** officially working in IT. Before that, I spent time working on smaller projects to fund my journey into the world of development, and now I specialize in building cutting-edge tools with technologies like **C#**, **.NET**, and **Azure**.

## ‚ö° My Tech Stack & Skills:

- **Languages**: C#, C++, Python, Powershell, HTML/XAML and some other smaller languages.
- **Frameworks**: .NET (MAUI, WPF, Blazor)
- **Platforms**: Azure, Unity, VRChat, Windows, Linux, Android
- **Domains**: Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Project Management, Product Management, IT Administration, DevOps, Software Development, Information Security (ISO/IEC 27001)

I also dabble with **AI** and **custom models** during both work and free time, leveraging tools like **Azure Machine Learning** and **Unity** to bring advanced features into projects.

## üåü Projects I‚Äôm Proud Of:

### [VRChat MagicChatbox](https://github.com/BoiHanny/vrcosc-magicchatbox)
A powerful, dynamic chatbox tool for **VRChat**, blending **AI** and **3D interfaces** to elevate the virtual communication experience. This project started small but has grown into something much larger‚Äîshowcasing my love for innovation in both **VR** and **AI** spaces.

## üöÄ Current Focus:
I'm currently investing much of my time in **business strategies** and **personal growth**, reading knowledge-filled **books** to grow in the business space. I‚Äôm gaining deep knowledge in AI, coding, the human mind, and psychology, which help shape both my personal and professional development.

In my free time, I continue to work on the **MagicChatbox** project, while also doing smaller **Unity** and **Blender** projects whenever I have some extra time.

## üí° Fun Fact:
Before I officially entered the IT and AI space, I built smaller projects to fund my tools and learning. This entrepreneurial mindset still drives me, pushing me to constantly learn, innovate, and create.
