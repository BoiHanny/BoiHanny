### Welcome to my GitHub profile, I'm Hanny ðŸ‘‹


I'm a coding wizard who loves to turn my wildest ideas into helpful tools. I specialize in C# WinForm/WPF and I have 4 years of self-taught coding experience.
<br><br>

âš¡ I'm currently working on my VRChat oscMagicChatbox application, it started as a small project, but now it's grown into something much bigger.
<br> Take a look and you may just learn a thing or two from my code. Who knows, it might even surprise you!<br>

âš¡In addition to my coding skills (nope), I also have experience in 3D modeling using Blender, and have a good understanding of Unity regarding avatars for VRChat.
